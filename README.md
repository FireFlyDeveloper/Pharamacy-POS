# **Inventory and Point of Sale System**

This project is designed to manage products, track inventory levels, and support fast checkout operations through barcode scanning. It provides a simple and efficient solution for small businesses that need to monitor stock, record purchases, and maintain updated product information.

The system includes authentication for a single user, secured with JWT. It allows adding, updating, and removing products, with each product tied to a unique barcode for quick lookup. Password management is also supported, enabling the user to change their account password when needed.

Built with PostgreSQL as the database, the system ensures reliable data handling and smooth communication with the backend. It aims to deliver a straightforward, practical, and user-friendly inventory and POS workflow.
